\title{tailor: Iterative Steps for Postprocessing Model Predictions}
\description{
Postprocessors refine predictions outputted from machine learning models to improve predictive performance or better satisfy distributional limitations. This package introduces 'tailor' objects, which compose iterative adjustments to model predictions. A number of pre-written adjustments are provided with the package, such as calibration. See Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, and Phillips (1977) \doi{10.1007/978-94-010-1276-8_19}. Other methods and utilities to compose new adjustments are also included. Tailors are tightly integrated with the 'tidymodels' framework.
