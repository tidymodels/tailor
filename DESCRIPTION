Description: Postprocessors refine predictions outputted from machine learning
     models to improve predictive performance or better satisfy distributional 
     limitations. This package introduces 'tailor' objects, which compose 
     iterative adjustments to model predictions. A number of pre-written 
     adjustments are provided with the package, like calibration and equivocal 
     zones, as well as utilities to compose new ones. Tailors are tightly 
     integrated with the 'tidymodels' framework.
